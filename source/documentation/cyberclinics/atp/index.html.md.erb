**Advanced threat protection (ATP)** refers to a category of security solutions that defend against sophisticated malware or hacking-based attacks targeting sensitive data. 
Advanced threat protection solutions can be available as software or as managed services.

Microsoft provide a range of ATP services which integrate into  M365 / Azure / On Prem environments.

- Note : Information contained in this detail on M365 features and costs regarding Microsoft references were correct as of May 2021.

<font size="5">**Things to consider for Microsoft ATP**</font>

- Now i know what you are thinking - it can’t all be good can it ?

- Well you are right. In a large estate the biggest downside is without a doubt **cost.**

- Almost all of the features that would attract you to the ATP/Defender services are add-on licensing unless you have E5. And E5 is not inexpensive.

- **Detection.** With reference to Defender AV, as with any AV product, there is no 100% guarantee of detection, but the outbreak and containment features when it is integrated into the other product sets are a plus point. 

- Microsoft Defender AV is pattern-based, so it can only detect zero-day exploits if they have already been included in the security intelligence updates.

- In general the **biggest threat to security are end users**, so if you don’t educate them regularly on security risks and how to avoid them it doesn’t matter how good your ATP system is.

- **When you implement the MS Threat Protection and keep it up to date, and keep monitoring it, it will give you a good overview of your estate from a security perspective.**

<font size="5">**Microsoft ATP - Component Pieces:**</font>

The ‘Threat Protection’ included in the E5 / E5 Security license plans are built up of the following:

- **Microsoft Defender ATP** - unifies your incident response process by integrating key capabilities across Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Microsoft Defender for Office 365, Microsoft Cloud App Security, and Microsoft Defender for Identity. This unified experience adds powerful features you can access in the Microsoft 365 security center.

- **Microsoft Defender for Identity** - used as part of your Microsoft 365 tenancy

- **Microsoft Defender AV (Endpoint)**- used on Windows 10 endpoints to provide anti-malware and anti-virus capabilities.

- **Microsoft Defender for Office 365** - a cloud-based email filtering service that helps protect your organization against unknown malware and viruses by providing robust zero-day protection, and includes features to safeguard your organization from harmful links in real time.

Note : Microsoft Defender AV and Device Guard are also part of E3. 

<font size="5">**Doesn’t Microsoft Exchange Online have protection ?**</font>

Well, sort of...

- ** Exchange Online Protection** is present which prevents broad, volume-based, known attacks. EOP is included in all Microsoft 365 organizations with Exchange Online mailboxes.	

- ** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1** is the next level to go to, which protects email and collaboration from zero-day malware, phish, and business email compromise.	

- ** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P2** is the current top level of protection which adds post-breach investigation, hunting, and response, as well as automation, and simulation (for training). This is included as part of E5 / E5 Security.

- Ref: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/overview 

- EOP can also be used in a standalone scenario - it provides cloud-based email protection for your on-premises Exchange organization or for any other on-premises SMTP email solution.

- It also can be deployed in a hybrid deployment - it can be configured to protect your email environment and control mail routing when you have a mix of on-premises and cloud mailboxes.

- If you have Defender for Office 365 Plan 1, it is a relatively small uplift in cost to move to Plan 2.

<font size="5">**Each level builds on the last**</font>

<img src="../../../assets/cyberclinics/ATP03.png" />

- The core of Office 365 security is EOP protection.

- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P1 contains EOP in it. 

- Defender for Office 365 P2 contains P1 and EOP. 

- The structure is cumulative. 

- That's why, when configuring this product, you should start with EOP and work to Defender for Office 365.

- Image Source : https://www.nakivo.com/microsoft-office-365-backup/microsoft-office-365-advanced-threat-protection-overview/ 

- Microsoft Defender for Office 365 P2 will give you this protection, and builds on both P1 and Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

<font size="4">**Why use Defender for Office ?**</font>

- Real-Time Protection from Sophisticated Attacks: Office 365 ATP protects your mailboxes, online storage, files, and other applications you’re using against any new, sophisticated attacks in real time.

<font size="5">**Comparison with 3rd Party Products**</font>

- You may have your own 3rd party products integrated into your system, such as a separate mail filter for inbound (and outbound) mailflow checking and analysis, localised AV protection and malware protection.

- Defender AV vs ‘Paid for’ AV protection. The cost saving may facilitate the purchase of the E5 Security add-on.

- Does a 3rd party ATP product compare favourably with the Microsoft Threat Protection Suite ?
The Gartner Magic Quadrant puts the MS offering in a very good position

- Integrating all the protection elements together into a Microsoft ATP based solution may be worth considering as it will give a centralised point of management.


<img src="../../../assets/cyberclinics/ATP06.png" />

- As you can see in this Gartner ‘Magic Quadrant’ image, Microsoft are in a very good position in the industry for their Threat Protection offerings.

<font size="5">**SLIDO 4**</font>

<font size="4">**What would be a barrier to you implementing further ATP / Defender products (or 3rd party ones) within your organisation? (31 Votes in total)**</font>

Cost - 87%

Leadership 'Buy-In' - 48%

Perceived Complexity - 29%

User Understanding - 13%

Other - 13%



<font size="5">**Summary**</font>

- This was a very high level overview of the offering for Threat Protection from Microsoft for their M365 suite and your Windows 10 Estate.

- The intention is to give you some ‘food for thought’ about your approach to threat protection and outbreak containment.

- Remember you are not just buying the license add on or upgrading your current licensing, you will also need to configure the product. For this we advise you to work with your Microsoft Partner (or Microsoft 365 Support themselves).

- From a personal perspective I would also recommend that you consider a 3rd party email filtering system for inbound email before it hits your M365 Exchange Online (or On premise Exchange!). Consider it ‘belt and braces’ !

Aside from Microsoft, please review these 3rd party websites for some alternative views on guidance around ATP’s capabilities.

Engage with your local IT MSP Organisation for how to implement within your organisation.
