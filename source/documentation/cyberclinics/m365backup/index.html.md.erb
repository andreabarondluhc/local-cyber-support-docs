# Backing up Microsoft 365 : Why Bother?

<font size="5">**‘But surely Microsoft back this up for me ?’**</font>
<font size="4">**No, they don’t.**</font>

- Microsoft provides powerful services within the Microsoft 365 platform– but a comprehensive backup of your Microsoft 365 data is not one of them. 

- Microsoft give you data availability and resilience, not historical data backups.

- Microsoft has physical security in their data centers. They offer data storage replication and redundancy.

- **None of the above equate to backing up your data** (in order to restore it in the event of a problem).

- Microsoft offer limited recovery periods* from deletion of your data, but if your data is compromised then so are the copies they keep.

- With Microsoft 365, it is your data, you control it and it is your responsibility to protect it. 

    Of over 1,000 IT professionals surveyed**, 81% experienced data loss in Microsoft 365, from simple user error to major data security threats.

- Microsoft 365 is not just your email. It is all the data which is provided by M365 - Teams data (including files stored here), Sharepoint Online file storage, OneDrive data.

- *Data retention periods vary and can be altered, but the maximum top level ‘recycle bin storage’ is approximately 30 days

- Microsoft offer limited recovery periods from deletion of your data - and the first stage recycle bin is generally 30 days in scenarios as above.

- Microsoft offer limited recovery periods from deletion of your data - and the first stage recycle bin is up to 30 days in scenarios as above.

<font size="5">**Why do I need to backup Microsoft 365 data?**</font>

- Ask yourself: How often do we restore user files on a regular day ?

- Then ask, What if we couldn’t restore a M365 located user file?
    
    If users overwrite or lose data, it can be restored quickly.
    
    If users leave, you don’t need to maintain their mailboxes (or license them!)
- If ransomware corrupts any of your data, uninfected versions can be restored from backup which is not part of the M365 Tenancy

    This is true across your M365 Tenancy: Teams / Sharepoint Online / Exchange Online / OneDrive

    Traditional File Servers are increasingly being replaced by Sharepoint Online and OneDrive
    
- Teams file storage (along with chat history) is much overlooked as it is considered to be short term use only, but Teams File Shares are a logical place for commonly shared files to reside rather than in a traditional file structure
    
    Microsoft do not back up these File Shares
    
- If employees (such as those who are about to leave or go through discipline) decide to hide or delete data, you’ve already safely backed it up.

- It’s another copy of your data in another location !

<font size="5">**Advantages to backing up Microsoft 365 data**</font>

- Covers your business with regard to Legal Retention Periods and Industry Regulations on data retention

- Microsoft Litigation Hold may not provide you with enough cover.

- If Litigation requires immediate access to user data, you have it.

- Reduced licensing costs for live user accounts. If a user leaves you do not need to maintain the mailbox / teams / sharepoint / onedrive data for that user for archive purposes, it will be backed up !

- **Once again, it’s a second copy of your data !**

<font size="4">**Backups:**</font>

<font size="3">**Implement a 3rd Party product to take your M365 data and duplicate it in a disconnected location:**</font>

<font size="2">**Alternate Cloud Locations (not a definitive list)**</font>

- Veeam Cloud Services

- Amazon Web Services

<font size="2">**Local Storage at your location or your DR location**</font>

<font size="3">**Product set to use to do this**</font>

<font size="2">**Multiple vendors exist, but the leaders to consider are:**</font>

- Veeam

- Arcserve

- SkyKick

- BackupVault

- BackBlaze

<font size="3">**Basics:**</font>

- Use MFA for logons. This will reduce the likelihood of accounts being compromised.

- Use Conditional Access Policies to satisfy security requirements, geographic location and device capabilities. This will aid in security.

<font size="5">**Examples of Microsoft 365 Backup Technologies**</font>

On the following slides there are illustrations of an ‘on premise’ backup system, and a ‘cloud based’ backup system.

These are purely examples of known popular systems and their inclusion here is simply as examples and are not endorsements from MHCLG.

<font size="5">**Example : Veeam for 365**</font>

Veeam offers an on premise companion product to its core product which is exclusively for M365.

It can take the contents of your M365 applications and send it to on-premise or cloud backup storage for storage, versioning and recovery at a very granular level.

<font size="5">**Example: SkyKick**</font>

SkyKick is a cloud based backup system for the Microsoft 365 Suite (Exchange Online, Sharepoint Online, OneDrive, Teams) which adds richer backup features to those which Microsoft provide. 

These will give you a much more granular set of recovery options.

This image details the Exchange Element, however the options for Sharepoint/OneDrive and Teams are equally feature rich.

<font size="5">**Recovery times**</font>

Assuming your deleted data is still available in M365 for recovery, the recovery times from a 3rd party product such as Veeam365 or SkyKick is much shorter, as illustrated in this graphic from SkyKick.

<font size="5">**To summarise**</font>

- Microsoft do not provide backups, **just availability.**

- Microsoft Online ‘Recycle Bins’ hold deleted items for a short period of time (as low as 30 days for some 365 Offerings)

- Without additional backups, corrupt data will prove very difficult to recover from

- **Protection from deliberate deletions are not covered by default with M365.**

- More data is moving into M365 as organisations move away from traditional file servers, and by default in M365 the recovery points may not be sufficient to meet your BC/DR plan derived RPO’s

- Backing up data to outside of M365 will give a greater opportunity for recovery, and in a much shorter period of time, thus enabling you to meet your RTOs

- Teams file storage is often overlooked, and backing it up will bring it into line with your regular file storage for RPO/RTO

- You can retain backups of former users without need to license the user in M365 for as long as the data may be required.

- You can store your backups locally onsite, in another cloud provider or offsite.
