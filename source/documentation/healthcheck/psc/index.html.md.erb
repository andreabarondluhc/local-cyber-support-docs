# ITHC Principle Security Concerns

<font size="5">**Introduction**</font>

<font size="4">**Purpose**</font>
This document presents a categorised set of Principle Security Concerns (PSC) for use within an IT Health Check scoping document. 

The PSCs have been derived following a recent Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) Mitigating Malware and Ransomware Survey conducted with Local Authorities during 2020. 

The suite of PSCs will assist Local Authorities to generate penetration testing scopes aligned with National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) areas of concerns and pertinent cyber threats.

<font size="4">**Scope**</font>
The PSCs are categorised into focus areas identified below as those providing defenses against ransomware and malware threats, viewed from an identify, protect, detect, respond and recover perspective

IT Health Check and NCSC ACD excluded.

<font size="5">**Principle Security Concerns**</font>

<font size="4">**1. Backup**</font>

<font size="3">**PSC-BU01**</font>
Organisations Active Directory system state is not being backed up and severely limits the organisation’s ability to recover directory services.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU02**</font>
Backup traffic is communicated in cleartext protocols and sensitive information is vulnerable to eavesdropping.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU03**</font>
Backup traffic is channel encrypted which allows sub optimal cipher suites.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU04**</font>
Backups are stored unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive information.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU05**</font>
Backups are stored using a weak encryption algorithm affording poor confidentiality protection.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU06**</font>
Backup servers are not leveraging latest build releases which may introduce known vulnerabilities.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU07**</font>
Backup servers are sub-optimally configured exposing unused services.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU08**</font>
Backup server operating systems are not hardened in line with best practice – Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Level 2
<font size="3">**PSC-BU09**</font>
Backup servers reside within the corporate Active Directory domain providing no defence against an escalated privilege lateral attack.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU10**</font>
Backups are stored on-network within the same authentication domain.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU11**</font>
Backup service accounts utilise weak and or non-complex password(s).
<font size="3">**PSC-BU12**</font>
Backup service account(s) credentials are locally cached on the backup server(s).
<font size="3">**PSC-BU13**</font>
Backup servers expose SMB service, increasing the attack surface for ransomware propagation.
<font size="3">**PSC-BU14**</font>
Administration of backup servers via remote desktop protocol is unrestricted from within the local area network.

<font size="4">**2. Multi-Factor Authentication**</font>

<font size="3">**PSC-MFA01**</font>
Cloud based administration accounts aren't protected with MFA exposing potential attack areas.
<font size="3">**PSC-MFA02**</font>
External remote access leveraging user based authentication is only a single factor.
<font size="3">**PSC-MFA03**</font>
On-premise privileged user account access is provided via single factor authentication only.

<font size="4">**3. Operating Systems**</font>

<font size="3">**PSC-OS01**</font>
Unsupported operating systems are present within the estate with known vulnerabilities.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS02**</font>
Supported operating systems are not patched within 14 days of vendor release.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS03**</font>
Unsupported systems have access to untrusted internet content.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS04**</font>
Vulnerable systems have exposed services which may provide a mechanism for an attacker to gain a foothold.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS05**</font>
Host based firewalls are not present and provide an increased attack surface.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS06**</font>
Antivirus / antimalware software is not present on target systems, increasing likelihood of successful malicious software insertion.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS07**</font>
Cached administrator credentials are present on systems increasing likelihood of successful privilege escalation attacks. 
<font size="3">**PSC-OS08**</font>
Desktop operating systems are not hardened in line with best practice – Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Level 2.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS09**</font>
Application whitelisting is not in place across critical systems to prevent known malicious code from executing.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS10**</font>
Host-based firewall rulesets are overly permissive providing little efficacy in filtering non-essential traffic.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS11**</font>
Mobile and tablet operating systems are not running a vendor supported release in receipt of security updates.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS12**</font>
Mobile devices are not subject to mobile device management technical governance.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS13**</font>
Mobile devices are not secured in accordance with NCSC guidance.
<font size="3">**PSC-OS14**</font>
Server operating systems are not hardened in line with best practice – Centre for Internet Security (CIS) Level 2.

<font size="4">**4. Active Directory**</font>

<font size="3">**PSC-AD01**</font>
Domain controllers are insufficiently hardened in accordance with industry best practice (CIS benchmark level 2) .
<font size="3">**PSC-AD02**</font>
Coarse grained privileged user account permissions provide a large account base with logon privileges to domain controllers.
<font size="3">**PSC-AD03**</font>
Complex passwords are not in place for privileged user accounts with domain wide permissions.
<font size="3">**PSC-AD04**</font>
Local administrator accounts may be standardised throughout server estate and therefore more susceptible to attack upon one being compromised.
<font size="3">**PSC-AD05**</font>
Standard user accounts are utilising passwords susceptible to brute force attacks.
<font size="3">**PSC-AD06**</font>
Accounts are susceptible to continuous login attempts with throttling / lockout controls being absent.

<font size="4">**5. Logging**</font>

<font size="3">**PAS-LOG01**</font>
Privileged user account logon success / failure is not centrally logged and alerted upon.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG02**</font>
User MFA authentication failures are not logged / alerted upon, resulting in nefarious activity potentially going undetected.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG03**</font>
Cloud service logs are isolated and not ingested into a central system for analysis and alerting.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG04**</font>
No alerting is configured within the central logging / SIEM solution to trigger event investigation and triage.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG05**</font>
Lack of event correlation rules limit alerting and detection of potential nefarious activity.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG06**</font>
Logs are susceptible to compromise / tampering as a consequence of weak RBAC controls
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG07**</font>
Log retention is less than 6 months potentially limiting historical analysis and investigative capability.
<font size="3">**PAS-LOG08**</font>
Backup job success / failure is not centrally logged and alerted upon.
